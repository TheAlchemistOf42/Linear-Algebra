Honor's Project for MA345-Linear Algebra

Andrew Crutcher
Description of Honor's Project Idea for MA345-740 Linear Algebra

This project is to fulfill my honor's contract for MA345-740 Linear Algebra
at SEMO.

Since I am a both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics major,
my plan is to write a program to perform different operations with matrices
to go above and beyond the regular class work in MA345 â€“ Linear Algebra.
This will include basic ones like addition and subtraction and more difficult
ones like like multiplication, finding determinants, and others.
Programming the operations of matrices requires complete understanding of the
operations to be able to program it.
It would be a command-line program that would accept input of numbers for the
matrices and give a menu allowing different operations like displaying a matrix,
modifying a matrix size, adding two matrices, multiplication, finding determinant, and others.
It would also check to make sure the operation could be completed for each
matrix before attempting to do the operation.
